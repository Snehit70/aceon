# CHAINSAW MAN DESIGN THEME BIBLE
> "A world where the mundane office life collides violently with eldritch horror."

## I. Core Philosophy: "Public Safety Bureau"
The aesthetic is NOT just "Cyberpunk" or "Military". It is **Corporate Grunge**.
It is the feeling of wearing a cheap suit to fight a demon in a dirty alleyway.

### The Contrast
*   **The Bureau (Order)**: Typewriters, file cabinets, ID badges, black suits, white shirts, ties. Clean lines, sans-serif fonts, grids.
*   **The Devil (Chaos)**: Blood splatters, intestines, rusting chains, glitching reality, noise, distortion.
*   **The Fusion**: A clean ID card... smeared with blood. A perfectly typed report... with the edges burned off.

## II. Color Palette

### Primary: The Hunter's Uniform
*   **Void Black**: `#050505` (The suits, the abyss)
*   **Crisp White**: `#F5F5F5` (The dress shirts, official documents)
*   **Blood Red**: `#E62E2D` (Violence, Energy, Power)

### Secondary: The "Easy Revenge" Tone
*   **Cigarette Smoke Grey**: `#A1A1AA` (Depression, concrete, smoke)
*   **Public Safety Teal**: `#0F4C5C` (The muted tone of the office walls/uniforms in the anime)
*   **Sunset Orange**: `#FF7E33` (The lighting in emotional scenes, Pochita)
*   **Acid Green**: `#CCFF00` (The "Kick Back" Opening energy, supernatural toxicity)

### Textures
*   **Halftone Dots**: Manga print feel.
*   **Noise/Grain**: 90s Film aesthetic.
*   **Paper Texture**: Crumpled reports.

## III. Typography

### 1. The "Opening Credit" Font (Display)
*   **Style**: Condensed, Heavy, Impactful.
*   **Font**: *Anton*, *Oswald*, or *Impact*.
*   **Usage**: Page Titles, "MISSIONS", "EXECUTE".
*   **Effect**: Kinetic typography. Letters should feel like they are slamming into place.

### 2. The "Report" Font (Body)
*   **Style**: Monospaced, Typewriter-like.
*   **Font**: *JetBrains Mono*, *Courier Prime*.
*   **Usage**: Subtitles, data, descriptions.
*   **Effect**: "Classified Intel".

## IV. UI Component Concepts

### 1. The "Contract" Card
Instead of a generic card, it's a **Binding Contract**.
*   **Border**: Double lines (like a legal form).
*   **Header**: "CONTRACT TARGET: [Name]".
*   **Footer**: "AUTHORIZED BY: [User]".
*   **Interaction**: Hovering feels like "Signing" (Color fill, stamp effect).

### 2. The "Pull Cord" Loader
*   **Visual**: A rip-cord handle in the center.
*   **Animation**: It vibrates/shakes before "revving up" the content.

### 3. The "Door" Modal
*   **Visual**: The forbidden door from Denji's dreams.
*   **Usage**: Login screens or "Locked" content. "DON'T OPEN IT."

### 4. The "Eye" Cursor
*   **Visual**: The cursor trails multiple eyeballs or uses a crosshair.

## V. Motion & Animation

*   **Snap Zoom**: Fast, aggressive camera movements (like the anime fight scenes).
*   **Glitch**: Not digital glitch, but **Film Burn**. Frames missing, jagged cuts.
*   **Liquid**: Blood dripping down elements (Progress bars filling up like a vial).

## VI. Implementation Strategy for Aceon

1.  **Re-skin Cards**: Make them look like "Case Files" (Manila folder colors or Bleak Office Grey).
2.  **Buttons**: "STAMP" style. High contrast.
3.  **Background**: Keep the noise, but maybe rotate between "Office" (Day mode) and "Devil Hunting" (Night mode).
